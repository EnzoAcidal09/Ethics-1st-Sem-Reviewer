<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>
What is the relationship between God and morality?

Does morality depend on God?

This question has long been debated among philosophers and theologians. Some argue that without God there can be no morality, while others maintain that moral principles are independent of divine will.
</pre>

<section class="card" id="three-roles">
<h2>Three Roles of God in Morality</h2>
<pre>
According to the lesson, God can play three possible roles in morality:

1. The Metaphysical Role
   God grounds the objectivity of moral principles.
   Without God, moral principles would be mere human conventions and lack universal binding force.

2. The Epistemological Role
   God provides the means by which humans can know moral truths—through revelation, reason, and conscience.

3. The Motivational Role
   God gives proportional motivation for moral behavior through reward and punishment in the afterlife.

Together these roles explain why, for the theist, God is integral to moral understanding and practice.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="dct">
<h2>Divine Command Theory (DCT)</h2>
<pre>
Divine Command Theory is the view that moral rightness depends on God's will.

An action is morally good if it is commanded by God, and morally wrong if it is forbidden by God.

Moral principles derive their authority from divine command. God’s will is the foundation of moral obligation.

This position makes God the ultimate source and standard of morality.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="euthyphro">
<h2>The Euthyphro Dilemma</h2>
<pre>
The Euthyphro dilemma originates from Plato’s dialogue “Euthyphro.”

It asks: “Is an action good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good?”

If actions are good because God commands them, then morality seems arbitrary—anything could be good if God willed it.
But if God commands actions because they are good, then goodness exists independently of God, undermining divine sovereignty.

This dilemma challenges the coherence of Divine Command Theory.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="responses">
<h2>Responses to the Euthyphro Dilemma</h2>
<pre>
Several responses have been offered by theists to defend the link between God and morality:

1. Natural Law (Aquinas)
   God’s commands are not arbitrary because they flow from His nature, which is perfectly good.
   Through reason, humans can discern the natural law that reflects divine wisdom.

2. Modified Divine Command Theory (Adams)
   Robert Adams proposes that moral obligation is constituted by the commands of a loving God.
   God’s nature, being essentially benevolent, ensures that His commands are not arbitrary.

3. Identity Thesis or Perfect Being Theology
   Goodness is identical with God’s very nature.
   God does not merely possess goodness; He is goodness itself.
   Hence, moral truths are grounded in the divine essence.
</pre>

<section class="card" id="problems-dct">
<h2>Problems for Divine Command Theory</h2>
<pre>
1. The Problem of Arbitrariness
   If morality depends solely on divine command, then whatever God wills becomes right, even if it appears cruel or unjust.

2. The Problem of Moral Abhorrence
   If God were to command acts like killing the innocent, DCT would force us to call such acts good.

3. The Problem of Emptiness
   “God is good” becomes a tautology if goodness simply means conformity to God’s will.

4. The Problem of Equivocation
   Equating God’s goodness with moral goodness risks using “good” in different senses, causing confusion.

5. The Problem of Divine Incomprehensibility
   Human beings cannot fully know God’s nature, hence cannot know moral truths with certainty if morality depends entirely on Him.

6. The Problem of Divine Hermeneutics
   Interpretation of divine commands varies; religious texts are subject to differing human understandings, leading to moral disagreement.

Each of these challenges questions whether morality can coherently depend on divine will alone.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="summary">
<h2>Summary and Reflection</h2>
<pre>
God plays a central role in many moral frameworks as the foundation, source, and ultimate judge of moral order.

However, philosophical critiques highlight tensions between divine command and moral autonomy.

While Divine Command Theory preserves the authority of God, Natural Law and Modified DCT seek to reconcile divine goodness with human reason.

The relationship between God and morality thus remains a vital topic for ethical reflection.
