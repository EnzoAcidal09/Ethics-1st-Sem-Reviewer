      <!-- Section: What is Ethics? -->
      <section class="card" id="what-is-ethics">
        <h2>What is ETHICS?</h2>
        <pre>
The word “ethics” came from the Greek word ‘ethos’, which translates as “character” or “manners”; it is also translated as
“characteristic or habitual ways of doing things” in some other references.

Ethics is the branch of Philosophy that studies the morality of human actions.

It is also called as Moral Philosophy and concerned with the rightness or wrongness of acts done by individuals and how they are
considered right or wrong.

      <!-- Section: Morality vs Ethics -->
      <section class="card" id="morality-vs-ethics">
        <h2>Morality — Ethics (brief distinction)</h2>
        <pre>
Morality refers to a person's or society's set of standards of what is right and wrong.

These are often instilled in childhood by family, friends, and other influences like the church or school.

People tend to accept these standards unquestioningly and mechanically.

Ethics is the discipline that examines these moral standards.

Thus, the science of morality.

It involves reflecting on and questioning the soundness and reasonableness of the moral beliefs and practices that a person
or society has.

Ethics invites self-awareness and self-criticism, prompting individuals to question the moral standards they've simply acquired
without critical inquiry.

      <!-- Section: Acts of Man vs Human Acts -->
      <section class="card" id="acts">
        <h2>Acts of Man — Human Acts</h2>
        <pre>
Acts of Man
Does not require will, intention, and knowledge.
Done spontaneously as they are natural to a person.
Considered morally neutral or amoral.
Examples include walking in a shopping mall, eating lunch, or brushing your teeth.
These acts DO NOT belong to a person's idea of morally right or wrong.

Human Acts
Requires will, intention, and knowledge.
Done voluntarily with awareness about the morality of the act and its consequences.
The person is aware of whether the action is naturally good or bad.
Examples include helping a needy person even if you're also in need, or killing someone you hate while knowing it's
wrong.
Subject to the study of ethics because they are the result of a person's choices and reason.

      <!-- Section: Three Determinants of Moral Actions -->
      <section class="card" id="determinants">
        <h2>Three Determinants of Moral Actions</h2>
        <pre>
A good intention can't make a bad action good. You can't steal money (bad object) even if you plan to give it to charity
(good intention).
"The end doesn't justify the means."

Motive
Purpose for which a human agent does the act.
"What specifically does the agent want?"

Object
The very substance of the act.
"What was performed by the agent?"

Circumstance
These are the specific conditions: who, what, when, where, how much.
Examples:
  - Taking $5 vs. taking $5,000 (how much)
  - Taking from a rich person vs. a poor person (who)
  - Taking during an emergency vs. for personal gain (when/why)

Circumstances can't make stealing good, but they affect how serious the wrongdoing is.
Some actions are always wrong no matter what. For instance, murdering an innocent person is always evil - even if you
have "good reasons" or special circumstances.

      <!-- Section: Areas of Ethics -->
      <section class="card" id="areas">
        <h2>Different Areas of Ethics</h2>
        <pre>
As a branch of philosophy that examines and reflects about morality, ethics is usually categorized into three general subject areas:
meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.

Meta-ethics
Also known as analytic ethics.
Looks into the nature, meaning, scope, and foundations of moral values and discourses.
It attempts to shed light on the basic ideas, concepts, and assumptions that underlie our moral beliefs and judgments.
It focuses on the more fundamental question "what morality itself is in the first place."

Normative Ethics
Concerned with the moral standards to determine right from wrong conduct.
It involves the formulation of moral norms or rules that can serve as basis of the kind of actions, institutions, and ways of life
that we should pursue.
Key Theories:
  1. Consequentialism - moral rightness is based on consequences.
  2. Deontology - moral rightness is based on the nature of the action itself, often following a rule.
  3. Virtue Ethics - moral rightness is based on the character of the person performing the act.

Applied Ethics
Concerned with the practical ethical issues in both the personal and social spheres.
It uses philosophical methods to examine the permissibility of specific actions and practices.
Specializations: Business ethics, medical ethics, environmental ethics, law, etc.
        </pre>
      </section>

      <!-- Section: Moral v. Non-moral Norms -->
      <section class="card" id="moral-nonmoral">
        <h2>Moral vs Non-Moral Norms</h2>
        <pre>
Non-Moral Norms
Refer to norms of fashion, mechanics of a game or sport, some house rules and rules of public institutions, and some laws.
Human acts or actions that are not related to morality or that cannot be morally and ethically judged as right or wrong.
Even if you violate some rules or standards above, you will not be called an immoral person.

Moral Norms
Refer to standards categorizing human acts as either moral or immoral.
These are the actions that can be ethically or morally judged as either right or wrong as they are related to our ideas of
what is ideally and morally good behaviors for a human person as a part of society and as an individual.

Moral Norm Examples:
  - Do not kill innocent people.
  - Do not steal.
  - Tell the truth.
  - Keep your promises.
  - Respect others’ dignity and rights.
  - Do not cause unnecessary harm.

      <!-- Section: Moral Principles (Seven) -->
      <section class="card" id="moral-principles">
        <h2>Moral Principles — Seven Traits</h2>
        <pre>
In order to guide us in living moral lives, we need moral principles. These principles constitute the blueprint from which our
actions and decisions should be based. In order to see whether a particular moral principle is valid, it should possess these
seven traits. Some of these traits are adopted from Louis Pojman while other traits are widely discussed.

1. Prescriptivity
Moral standards are generally put forth as injunctions or imperatives (such as, 'Do not kill,' 'Do no unnecessary harm,' and
'Love your neighbor'). These principles are proposed for use, to advise, and to influence action.

2. Universalizability
Moral principles should be possible to be made universal.
If one judges that act A is morally right for a certain person P, then it is morally right for anybody relevantly similar to P.

3. Overridingness
Moral principles have a unique authority over other considerations; they take precedence when in conflict with non-moral norms.

4. Impartiality
Moral standards are based on impartial considerations that give equal and adequate consideration to the interests of all concerned.

5. Practicability
(Discussed in the PDF as part of traits required for valid moral principles.)

6. Normativity
(Part of the list of characteristics ensuring that moral principles guide behavior.)

7. Publicity
(Moral principles should be public and known so people can conform and be judged by them.)

      <!-- Section: Moral Categories & Their Definitions -->
      <section class="card" id="moral-categories">
        <h2>Moral Categories & Their Definitions</h2>
        <pre>
Morally Neutral
Actions that are neither morally required nor forbidden; they carry no intrinsic moral weight.
These include truly neutral acts like choosing what clothes to wear; that are morally neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy.

Morally Right Act
A right act is an act that is either morally required for people to do or brings about positive moral implications and consequences.
Actions that one must perform; failing to do so is morally wrong or impermissible.
Obligatory actions are such that "it is wrong not to do them."
Example: The parents are thus ethically "obligated" to care for their children.

Supererogatory
These types of actions are seen as going “above and beyond the call of duty.” They are right to do, but it is not wrong not to do them.
Minimally supererogatory acts are good actions that go beyond the call of duty but do not involve a major self-sacrifice on the part of the doer.
Example: Giving a small amount of money to a classmate when they run out of money.

Heroic acts
Heroic actions involve major self-sacrifice, either sacrificing one’s life or one’s career in order to do the right thing.
Example: Diving in front of a grenade to save your comrades.

Morally Wrong Act
A wrong act is either an act that is morally forbidden for people to do or an extremely culpable wrongdoing.
Actions that one must NOT perform; doing so is morally wrong. Example: Stealing, lying, or cheating on a test.

Evil (Moral Evil)
Actions of profound moral wrongdoing, involving intentional harm, malice, cruelty, or severe moral violation.
Example: murder, genocide, sexual abuse, torture.

      <!-- Section: Freedom, Reason, Responsibility -->
      <section class="card" id="freedom-reason">
        <h2>Freedom — Reason — Responsibility</h2>
        <pre>
FREEDOM
The human person has free will as part of the rational soul, enabling choice, thought, and action.
Free will makes a person autonomous, able to decide their course of action in any situation.
True freedom is not just doing what pleases oneself but the capacity to choose morally good acts.
Without free will, the study of morality or ethics would be meaningless, since morality requires freedom.

Reason
To be moral, one must first be a rational being. Rationality means the ability to reason and grasp knowledge.
Without reason, a person cannot be moral.
Role of reason in morality: Humans know what is moral and immoral through reason.
Reason allows people to understand and justify actions in society. Reason, not instincts or feelings, should guide human actions.

Impartiality
Refers to judging actions without bias or prejudice. Requires objectivity in using reason to evaluate morality.
Being objective and disregarding personal preferences is necessary to be moral.
