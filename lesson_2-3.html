<h2>Introduction to Postmodern Approach</h2>
<pre>
Postmodern ethics emerged as a critique of modernist assumptions about reason, objectivity, and universality. 
It challenges the idea that there are single, absolute moral truths binding for all people at all times.
Instead, it argues that morality is historically and culturally situated, dependent on language, power, and context.
Postmodern thought calls into question the existence of universal foundations of morality and emphasizes plurality and difference.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="meta-ethics">
<h2>Meta-Ethical Theories</h2>
<pre>
Three dominant meta-ethical positions discussed in the postmodern context are:
1. Ethical Relativism – morality is relative either to the individual or to culture.
2. Ethical Skepticism – we cannot have knowledge of moral truths.
3. Ethical Objectivism – moral principles are valid and binding independently of individual or cultural opinion.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="moral-relativism">
<h2>Moral Relativism</h2>
<pre>
Moral Relativism: a meta-ethical theory which asserts that morality is relative to the subject, whether the subject refers to society or the individual. 

Morality as ultimately dependent on the individual is the claim of moral subjectivism, while morality being ultimately dependent on society is called moral conventionalism.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="moral-conventionalism">
<h2>Moral Conventionalism</h2>
<pre>
Moral Conventionalism holds that what is morally right or wrong depends on the customs, norms, and traditions of a society.

It claims that morality is a human invention, a product of culture intended for survival and order.

Arguments for Moral Conventionalism:
• Argument from Survival Value of Cultural Morality – moral rules are invented to ensure a society’s survival.
• Argument against Ethnocentrism – no culture has the right to impose its beliefs on another.
• Argument for Tolerance – we should accept cultural diversity; “live and let live.”

Problems:
• If practices are only “right” within their culture, no culture can ever be wrong, even if it practices slavery or genocide.
• Promoting tolerance as a universal value contradicts relativism, because it asserts a universal moral rule.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="answer-conventionalism">
<h2>Answering Moral Conventionalism</h2>
<pre>
The survival argument fails when customs are not related to survival (e.g., harmful traditions).
The argument against ethnocentrism contradicts itself: if each society defines morality, then ethnocentric societies would also be “right.”
The argument for tolerance collapses, because if all values are relative, then intolerance must also be “right” for some groups.

Thus, moral conventionalism cannot logically oppose harmful or unjust customs, nor defend tolerance consistently.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="moral-subjectivism">
<h2>Moral Subjectivism (Ethical Subjectivism)</h2>
<pre>
Moral Subjectivism holds that what is right or wrong depends solely on an individual's personal opinion or feelings.

“Morality is in the eye of the beholder.”

Arguments for Moral Subjectivism:
• Argument from Moral Disagreement – people disagree about moral issues, so no objective truth exists.
• Argument from Queerness – moral facts would be “queer” or strange entities unlike anything else in the world.
• Argument from Relativity of Truth – if all truth is relative, so is morality.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="answer-subjectivism">
<h2>Answering Moral Subjectivism</h2>
<pre>
Disagreement does not imply absence of truth.
Disagreements occur in science, yet that does not mean there are no scientific facts.

Three Types of Moral Disagreement:
1. Factual Disagreements – based on different understandings of evidence.
2. Meaning Disagreements – over the definitions of terms (e.g., “justice,” “love”).
3. Value Disagreements – differences in moral priorities (e.g., freedom vs. equality).

Only value disagreements are truly hard to resolve, but even they assume there is an objective moral truth worth discussing.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="moral-objectivism">
<h2>Moral Objectivism and Moral Absolutism</h2>
<pre>
Moral Objectivism holds that there are moral principles valid for all people, regardless of opinion or culture.

Moral Absolutism, a stricter form, asserts that some moral duties admit no exceptions whatsoever (e.g., Kant’s prohibition on lying).

Objectivists agree that moral norms are universal, but allow that duties can be balanced (prima facie duties) rather than absolute.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="prima-facie">
<h2>Prima Facie Duties (W.D. Ross)</h2>
<pre>
Prima facie duties are obligations that are binding unless overridden by a stronger duty.

Examples:
• Duty to tell the truth
• Duty to keep promises
• Duty to prevent harm
• Duty to promote good

Unlike Kant’s absolute rules, these duties can conflict; one may override another when moral reasoning deems it necessary.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="arguments-objectivism">
<h2>Arguments for Moral Objectivism</h2>
<pre>
1. Argument from Intuition
Normal people recognize acts like genocide, rape, and slavery as objectively wrong. If subjectivism were true, we couldn’t condemn them.

2. Argument from the Phenomenology of Moral Disagreement
Moral debates assume objective truth; both sides try to prove they are right, not just expressing feelings.

3. Argument from Epistemic Realism
Moral reasoning assumes shared intellectual duties—honesty, logic, fairness—implying objective moral norms.

4. Argument from Moral Responsibility
We hold people accountable for wrongdoing, implying universal moral standards.

5. Moral Dilemmas and Value Pluralism
Conflicts between values (freedom vs. well-being) don’t mean morality is subjective—only that objective values can sometimes clash.

6. Moral Epistemology
Objectivists explain moral knowledge through conscience or moral intuition—an immediate awareness of right and wrong refined through reason and experience.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="relativity">
<h2>Argument from the Relativity of Truth</h2>
<pre>
Postmodern thought, influenced by Nietzsche, denies objective truth, claiming all truth is relative.
"There is no truth, only interpretation."
Example: Multiple sects within Christianity arise from different interpretations of the Bible.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="response-relativity">
<h2>Response to the Argument from the Relativity of Truth</h2>
<pre>
Ask the relativist: “Is that objectively true?”

If yes, it contradicts itself.
If no, it’s unjustified.

Thus, the statement “there is no objective truth” is self-defeating.
</pre>
</section>

<section class="card" id="summary">
<h2>Summary of the Postmodern Approach</h2>
<pre>
• Postmodern ethics rejects universal moral foundations.
• Emphasizes culture, context, and interpretation.
• Moral Conventionalism and Subjectivism fail to explain moral accountability.
• Moral Objectivism offers stronger grounding through reason, intuition, and human dignity.
